# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

DeepScout is a new project that appears to be in early initialization stage. The repository currently contains minimal files with only a basic README.md and Claude Code configuration.

## Current Project Structure

This is a fresh repository with:
- README.md: Basic project title "DeepScout"
- .claude/settings.local.json: Claude Code permissions configuration allowing Bash find commands

## Development Status

The project is in its initial state with no source code, build scripts, or package configuration files present yet. The repository structure and development workflow are yet to be established.

## Next Steps for Development

Since this is a new project, the following will need to be established:
- Choose technology stack and create appropriate configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- Set up project structure with source directories
- Configure build, test, and lint commands
- Define the project's core functionality and architecture

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the project evolves and more development infrastructure is added.
